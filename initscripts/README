The sub-directories of this directory contain configuration files to allow PiDiskLeds and PiNetLeds
to run automatically during system boot, before any user has logged in.


./systemd
---------
The configuration files in this directory are used if you are running a linux distribution which
utilizes "systemd" (e.g. Raspbian "Jessie" or Raspbian "Stretch").

1. If needed, edit the "./systemd/*.service" files to add the appropriate "-p", "-r", etc. options to
   the "ExecStart" line.
2. Copy the "./systemd/*.service" files to the "/etc/systemd/system/" directory. For example:
  sudo cp ./systemd/*.service /etc/systemd/system/
3. Run the following command:
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
4. Run the following commands:
  sudo systemctl enable PiDiskLeds.service
  sudo systemctl enable PiNetLeds.service 

The configured LEDs should begin indicating disk and/or network activity upon the next system bootup.

To stop the LEDs from indicating activity, use the following commands:
  sudo systemctl stop PiDiskLeds.service
  sudo systemctl stop PiNetLeds.service

To restart the LED indications, use:
  sudo systemctl start PiDiskLeds.service
  sudo systemctl start PiNetLeds.service

To prevent the LED indications from automatically starting during boot, use:
  sudo systemctl disable PiDiskLeds.service
  sudo systemctl disable PiNetLeds.service


./sysVinit
----------
The configuration files in this directory are used if you are running a linux distribution which
utilizes "sysVinit" (e.g. Raspbian "Wheezy").

1. If needed, edit the "./sysVinit/*" files to add the appropriate "-p", "-r", etc. options in the
   "do_start ()" section
2. Copy the "./sysVinit/*" files to the "/etc/init.d/" directory. For example:
  sudo cp ./sysVinit/* /etc/init.d/
3. Run the following commands: 
  sudo update-rc.d PiDiskLeds enable
  sudo update-rc.d PiNetLeds enable

The configured LEDs should begin indicating disk and/or network activity upon the next system bootup.

To stop the LEDs from indicating activity, use the following commands:
  sudo service PiDiskLeds stop
  sudo service PiNetLeds stop

To restart the LED indications, use:
  sudo service PiDiskLeds start
  sudo service PiNetLeds start

To prevent the LED indications from automatically starting during boot, use:
  sudo update-rc.d PiDiskLeds disable
  sudo update-rc.d PiNetLeds disable
